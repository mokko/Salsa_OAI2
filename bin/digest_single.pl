=head1 NAME

digest_single.pl - store relevant from a single big mpx file into SQLite db

=head1 SYNOPSIS

digest_single.pl file.mpx

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This helper script reads in a big mpx lvl2 file, processes it and stores
relevant information into an SQLite database for use in OAI data provider.
At this point, I am not quite sure how I will call the data provider. See
Salsa_OAI anyways.

For development purposes, this file should have everything that is mpx
specific, so that HTTP::OAI::DataProvider doesn't have any of it. Later,
the mpx specific stuff should go into the Dancer front-end.

=head2 Database Structure

table 1 records
-ID
-identifier
-datestamp
-metadata

table 2 sets
-setSpec
-recordID

=head1 KNOWN ISSUES / TODO

=head2 Missing related info

Currently, this incarnation deals only with the mpx's sammlungobjekt, but the
later xslt will have to access related info from personKÃ¶rperschaft and multi-
mediaobjekt as well. Hence, we need those two. I should store them in the same
xml blob as the main sammlungsobjekt. This requires rewriting extractRecords.
It no longer can parse sammlungsobjekt by sammlungsobjekt, but needs a
different loop with access to more or less the whole document.

=head2 Wrong package?

Currently, this script is part of HTTP::OAI::DataProvider, but its mpx specific
parts should later go to Dancer front end. When it exists.
