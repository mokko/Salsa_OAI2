<h1>About Salsa OAI</h1>
<p>Salsa OAI is a simple OAI 2.0 data provider. For more see
https://github.com/mokko/Salsa_OAI2</p>

<h2>Currently supported</h2>
<ul>
	<li>All six OAI v2.0 verbs should work.</li>
	<li>All errors as described in the specification work.</li>
	<li>ResumptionToken works</li>
</ul>

<h2>Not (yet) supported</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Deleted records. I currently have no reliable info on deleted
	records in my source data, so I have a hard time implementing it, but
	it should almost work.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Components</h2>

<p>Salsa OAI is a small frontend to HTTP::OAI::DataProvider (on
Github.com). Currently there is only one sqlite database backend. In the
past I experimented with a file-based solution, but this easily leads to
memory shortages.</p>
