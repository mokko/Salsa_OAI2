<title>Salsa OAI - Minimalistic OAI data provider with Dancer</title>
</header>
<body>
<h1>About Salsa_OAI</h1>
<p>Salsa_OAI is a simple OAI data provider. Currently it works with
xml files (one per record) and avoids a database all together; for
future plans, see below. It is written in perl, available on GitHub and
uses T. Brody's excellent HTTP::OAI as well as Dancer, a new and cool
web framework with a vibrant comunity. Salsa_OAI is written by Maurice
Mengel for the Ethnological Museum in Berlin and MIMO (see
http://mimo-project.eu).</p>
<h2>Metadata formats</h2>
<p>Salsa_OAI is agnostic about the metadata formats used. You can
use whatever you like as the native xml format as long as you provide a
XSLT 1.0 transformation to the desired output format. How cool is that?</p>

<h2>Avoiding the database</h2>
<p>Salsa_OAI reads OAI header information directly into memory. It
uses a file cache to do so, which speeds up extracting the OAI header
information from the records. This solution is NOT sustainable (i.e.
will not scale well when your repository grow). But with a few thousand
records it might work surprisingly well. The motto is: just one notch up
from a static repository. The number of records you can serve
comfortably depends mainly on the memory of your server. I might write a
database extension later, which would offer a simple upgrade. I expect
Salsa OAI not to run a lot faster with a database, but to be able to
deal with a lot more records.</p>
<p>Upshot of avoiding a database is the it makes developing, testing
and maintaning Salsa_OAI easy!</p>

<p>File Cache for ListRecords.</p>

<h2>Currently supported</h2>
<ul>
	<li>All six verbs of OAI v2.0 should work in a rudimentary way.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>Salsa OAI is written for easy maintenance and extensibility, not
for speed. It is very possible that it is too slow for you. Should be in
the implementation specific stuff</p>

<p>I provide some performance statistics, so you can see for
yourself.</p>

<h2>Not yet supported / TODO</h2>
<ul>
	<li>TODO: Check that all error messages demanded by the
	specification are supported.</li>
	<li>resumptionToken</li>
	<li>hierarchical Sets</li>
	<li>Stream response. Should speed up listRecords and
	listIdentifiers A LOT ;-)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
