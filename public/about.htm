<title>Salsa OAI - Minimalistic OAI data provider with Dancer</title>
</header>
<body>
<h1>About Salsa OAI</h1>
<p>Salsa OAI is a simple OAI 2.0 data provider.</p>

<h2>Currently supported</h2>
<ul>
	<li>All six OAI v2.0 verbs should work in a rudimentary way.</li>
	<li>All error as described in the specification work. I still need
	to check that.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Not (yet) supported</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Specification</li>
	<ul>
		<li>TODO: Check that all error messages demanded by the
		specification are supported.</li>
		<li>resumptionToken</li>
		<li>hierarchical Sets</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Server setup / Salsa_OAI architecture</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Stream response. Should speed up listRecords and
		listIdentifiers A LOT ;-)</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Components</h2>

<p>Salsa OAI has several components: a backend, a frontend and a
data store engine.</p>

<h2>Engines</h2>

<p>First version (which could easily be resurrected) avoided a
database. This version uses sqlite as a database. It should soon be easy
to plugin different database engines of your choice. Salsa OAI is
written in perl, available on GitHub and uses T. Brody's excellent
HTTP::OAI as well as Dancer, a new and cool web framework with a vibrant
comunity (See <a href="http://perldancer.org">http://perldancer.org</a>
). Salsa OAI is written by Maurice Mengel for the Ethnological Museum in
Berlin and MIMO (see http://mimo-project.eu).</p>
<h2>Metadata formats</h2>
<p>Salsa OAI is mostly agnostic about the metadata formats used. You
can use whatever you like as the native xml format as long as you
provide a XSLT 1.0 transformation to the desired output format. How cool
is that?</p>

<h2>SQLite</h2>
<p>New version works with SQLite.</p>

<h2>Avoiding a database: memory and disk instead</h2>
<p>Using its simple engine, Salsa OAI reads OAI header information
directly into memory. It uses a file cache to do so, which speeds up
extracting the OAI header information from the records. This solution is
NOT sustainable (i.e. will not scale well when your repository grows).
But with a few thousand records it might work surprisingly well. The
motto is: just one notch up from a static repository. Of course, the
number of records you can serve comfortably depends mainly on the memory
of your server.</p>

<p>I experimented with a file cache for ListRecords to save the
potentially big result document on disk. It sort of worked.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>Salsa OAI is written for easy maintenance and extensibility, not
for speed. It is very possible that it is too slow for you. Should be in
the implementation specific stuff</p>

<p>I provide some performance statistics, so you can see for
yourself.</p>
