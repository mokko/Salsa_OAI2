This is work in progress and not yet completed, but I am working on it. A
working version should be ready around Christmas. This Christmas, not perl6
Christmas.

Anyway, this is an implementation of HTTP::OAI::DataProvider (also on github)
and I am still in the middle of refacturing. Just thought it would be good to
have a copy on github kind of as a backup.
