<title>Salsa OAI - Perl OAI data provider with Dancer</title>
</header>
<body>
<h1>About Salsa OAI</h1>
<p>Salsa OAI is a simple OAI 2.0 data provider. It uses Dancer and a
specific metadata format called mpx. Salsa OAI is a specific
implementation of HTTP::OAI::DataProvider. You could regard Salsa OAI as
an example of how to set up your own HTTP::OAI::DataProvider.</p>
<p>HTTP::OAI::DataProvider tries not to depend on perl Dancer, it is
metadata format agnostic and modularized. Currently it works with an
easy-to-install sqlite backend, but it should be fairly easy to write
another backend.</p>
<p>Salsa OAI and HTTP::OAI::DataProvider are written in 2010/2011 by
Maurice Mengel for the <a href="http://mimo-project.eu>MIMO Project</a>.</p>

<h2>Currently supported</h2>
<ul>
	<li>All six OAI v2.0 verbs should work.</li>
	<li>All errors as described in the specification work.</li>
	<li>ResumptionToken works</li>
</ul>

<h2>Not (yet) supported</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Deleted records. I currently have no reliable info on deleted
	records in my source data, so I have a hard time implementing it, but
	it should almost work.</li>
